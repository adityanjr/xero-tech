For YoloV3 Weights-->

!wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

## YoloV4:

This folder container scrpit of YoloV4 and output images as a result of testing on yoloV4

## yolo_detect.py:

Script for yoloV3

## Images:

Contains images on which our code is tested

## Output:

Contains images result from yolov3 detection.

## On night vision:

YoloV4 perform 10% better as it is detecting car as toyoto or mercedes, changing class name to car will help.

## YoloV4

car_brand_classifier_yolov4.py is used for testing
